    <h1>To you,</h1>

    <p>
      I’m writing this without expectations.
      Not to change your mind,
      not to pull you back,
      but because I owe you an apology.
    </p>

    <p>
      I understand now that my words and actions hurt you.
      Even if I didn’t mean to,
      the impact was still real.
      And I take responsibility for that.
    </p>

    <p>
      You weren’t wrong for feeling the way you did.
      You weren’t too much.
      And you weren’t imagining the pain.
    </p>

    <p>
      I’m sorry for the moments where I should have been more patient,
      more careful,
      and more understanding.
    </p>

    <p>
      You don’t owe me forgiveness.
      You don’t owe me a reply.
      I just wanted you to know that I acknowledge what I did,
      and I’m truly sorry.
    </p>

    <p>
      I hope life treats you gently.
    </p>
