      To my first and last love of my life,<br>
      Tanishkka… i want to say something..
    </h1>

  <!-- LETTER (YOUR WORDS UNCHANGED) -->
  <div class="letter" id="letter">
    <h1>To you,</h1>

    <p>
      I know my sorry isn’t enough to clear my mistakes…
      I know I lost your trust, and with that, your respect.
      And I understand why you became cold. I wasnt much 
      good to you in last few months and you lost that
      feeling you used to adore me and that warmth but still
      I feel like you love me, I miss you so much...
    </p>

    <p>
      Still, I want to apologize wholeheartedly.
      I am truly sorry, all that stupid mistakes
      I made and hurted you in a unimaginable way
      and staying up with wont end bad, if it does
      I'll be the baddest all of them
      and I really love you darling...
    </p>

    <p>
      I know you’re tired of my bullshit,
      tired of everything repeating,
      tired of getting hurt again.
      I know you don’t want to go through all of this again...
      but I am a changed man and I had thought a lot
    </p>

    <p>
      I know you’ve been crying.
      I know you’ve been heartbroken.
      I know you’ve been losing sleep,
      It breaks my heart to see you like this...
    </p>

    <p>
      I’m not asking you to forget what I did,
      and I’m not asking you to pretend it didn’t matter.
      But if we ever tried to truly understand each other one more time,
      I believe we could fix things…
      without erasing the past...
    </p>

    <p>
      This place changed me in ways I didn’t realize.
      It isolated me,
      it messed with my head.
      I won’t use it as an excuse for my actions,
      but you know this place hasn’t been good for me either...
    </p>

    <p>
      I’m staying out more now.
      My mind is slowly gaining clarity.
      I see things differently than before...
    </p>

    <p>
      I know you don’t owe me anything.
      I know you might never trust me the same way again.
      But I needed you to know that I’m willing to change,
      not just say it...
    </p>

    <p>
      I still think about our good times,
      not to escape my mistakes,
      but to remember what we once were...
    </p>

    <p>
      Whatever you decide,
      I’ll accept it. Just tell me in the call
      I just want to hear from your mouth..
      honestly...
    </p>
