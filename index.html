    <h1>To you,</h1>

    <p>
      I know my sorry isn’t enough to clear my mistakes…
      I know I lost your trust, and with that, your respect.
      And I understand why you became cold. and you lost that
      feeling you used to adore me and that warmth but still
      I feel like you love me, I miss you so much...
    </p>

    <p>
      Still, I want to apologize wholeheartedly.
      I am truly sorry, all that stupid mistakes
      I made and hurted you in a unimaginable way
      and staying up with wont end bad, if it does
      I'll be the baddest all of them
      and I really love you darling...
    </p>

    <p>
      I know you’re tired of my bullshit,
      tired of everything repeating,
      tired of getting hurt again.
      I know you don’t want to go through all of this again...
      but I am a changed man and I had thought a lot
    </p>

    <p>
      I know you’ve been crying.
      I know you’ve been heartbroken.
      I know you’ve been losing sleep,
      It breaks my heart to see you like this...
    </p>

    <p>
      I’m not asking you to forget what I did,
      and I’m not asking you to pretend it didn’t matter.
      But if we ever tried to truly understand each other one more time,
      maybe we could work things out…
      without erasing the past...
    </p>

    <p>
      This place changed me in ways I didn’t realize.
      It isolated me,
      it messed with my head.
      I won’t use it as an excuse for my actions,
      but you know this place hasn’t been good for me either...
    </p>

    <p>
      I’m staying out more now.
      My mind is slowly gaining clarity.
      I see things differently than before...
    </p>

    <p>
      I know you don’t owe me anything.
      I know you might never trust me the same way again.
      But I needed you to know that I’m willing to change,
      not just say it...
    </p>

    <p>
      I still think about our good times,
      not to escape my mistakes,
      but to remember what we once were...
    </p>

    <p>
      Whatever you decide,
      I’ll accept it. Just tell me in the call
      I just want to hear from your mouth..
      honestly...
    </p>
